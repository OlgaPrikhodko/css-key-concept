          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and
            accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with
            poorly designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both
            developers and users). This often comes down to a lack of
            understanding around different user needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designing pages that are accessible for everyone shouldn't be too
            difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have collated an
            'easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep this guide handy… When creating your own websites you can check
            these criteria off the list!

        <section id="section-accesebility">
          <h3>Accessibility Checks:</h3>
          <p>
            Heading elements & Page Titles: HTML heading elements have been used
            to represent page structure, supporting assistive technologies that
            allow page navigation from heading to heading.
          </p>
          <p>
            Re-size Text: You can vary text size by using your browser's text
            resize settings (through Options or Preferences), text-only zoom,
            page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring
            styling issues / text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alternative text for images: All images have been given appropriate
            alternative text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Link text: All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of
            context, and hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text
            style from normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page,
            it has been labelled as doing so. JavaScript independence: Where
            JavaScript or other scripts are used for navigation or
            functionality, an alternative mechanism has been put in place in
            case your browser does not support these scripts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Colour contrast: has been checked for text and background colour
            combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I have
            also ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Style sheets: If style sheets are not supported or are turned off,
            information on the site can still be accessed and read.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forms: forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with
            them using only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The
            form labels themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and
            making it easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.

            By spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks
